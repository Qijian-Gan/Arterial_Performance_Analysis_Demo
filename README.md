# Arterial_Performance_Analysis_Demo
This is the Repo (demo) to analyze data quality from arterial loop sensors. It consists of two parts: (i) detector health analysis module (in the "src" folder),
and (ii) arterial performance dashboard (in the "website" folder). The data we used is in the interval of 5 minutes. The test site is the arterial
network in Arcadia, CA.
